		<h3>Campus Crusade for Christ</h3>

		<p>When Bill and Vonette Bright first launched Campus Crusade for Christ as a campus ministry in 1951, the underlying concept was to "win the campus today and change the world tomorrow." More than 60 years later, the mission is still the same.</p>
		<p>Today, the Campus Ministry of Cru (formerly Campus Crusade for Christ) is a network of vibrant, growing movements on 1,131 campuses in the United States and beyond. Proven and diverse outreach strategies expose millions of students to the gospel each year. Over the past five years, more than 37,300 students made a decision to become a Christian and 3,250 students chose to enter full time ministry with Campus Crusade for Christ.</p>
		<p>Cru has a rich history of students believing God for great things. College students have been taking one year STINTs and launching new campus ministries all over the world in places such as Russia, East Asia, and the Middle East. College students reaching college students--that's the history of Cru.</p>
		<p>And that history continues to be made. Right now on campuses all over the world students are ready to respond to the gospel. Yet, more laborers--students and those fresh out of college--are needed. God is calling people who desire to pioneer new ministries in the United States and around the world.</p>
		<p>That's why the Campus Ministry of Cru has developed this unique avenue of ministry. You could be a Campus Ministry Intern--a one-year commitment to believe God to do something powerful in and through your life. We've been sending students for a one-year STINT overseas for years, and now we're ready to send students everywhere--both in the United States and internationally.</p>
		<p>Perhaps you're not sure what you'll do with the rest of your life. Perhaps you would like to give a year of your life to reaching students, discipling leaders, and establishing new student ministries. Or maybe you can picture yourself using your skills in your field of study for ministry. Maybe you would just like to spend a year getting a feel for full-time ministry.</p>
		<p>What can happen in a year? In just a year, you could pioneer a new ministry on a campus overseas. In just a year, you could open up new campus ministries in the United States. In just a year, you could establish a ministry to reach ethnic students on a campus.</p>
		<p>And why go alone? Bring your friends with you! Ministry is much more effective when it's done by teams of people believing God and working together.</p>
		<p>Look through history. Thousands have gone before us to reach students. Now it's our turn. It's our turn to be the new pioneers who build the foundations for the next century.</p>
		<p>Come and be a Campus Ministry Intern. There's a multitude of opportunities.</p>
