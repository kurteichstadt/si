		<h3>A new sister in Christ in East Asia<br/>
			<span style="font-size: 11px; font-weight: normal;">from Sherri, East Asia</span></h3>

<p>Sherri was riding her bike home from class when she decided to stop at a restaurant and order fried rice. While waiting for her food, Sherri walked over to a music store to look around. As she was leaving the store, a girl hurried to Sherri's side and asked excitedly, "Will you be my language partner?" Sherri knew she already had several language partners, but she did want to meet with this girl at least once. So she took down Christine's* phone number and assured her that she would get in touch with her soon.</p>
<p>Weeks had passed and Sherri kept thinking about the girl from the music store. She tried to call her multiple times and was never successful. Finally, when Sherri had all but given up, Christine returned her calls and they agreed to meet later that week.</p>
<p>Christine brought Sherri to her dorm room so they could study where it was quiet. As they entered the room Sherri realized that they were alone and sensed that this would be a perfect time to talk to her new friend about what she believed. </p>
<p>Christine asked Sherri what she liked to do in her free time. Sherri responded that she liked to watch movies, read books, and since she was a Christian, she liked to spend time reading the Bible and singing Christian songs with Christian friends. The conversation continued in another direction, and then Sherri decided that she would try to bring up her faith again.</p>
<p>Sherri paused and asked "Just now when I told you I was a Christian, what did you think?" Her friend responded, "I know very little about it, although I have heard some about Jesus in class." </p>

<p>Sensing that the time was perfect Sherri began to speak passionately, "He is the most important thing in my life. I love Him so much and I wish everyone could know the whole story about Jesus." Christine replied quickly, "I would like to know more about Jesus. How can I find out?" Sherri was overjoyed at her quick interest, "I can tell you," she said, "I have a little book that gives a summary of the Bible, would you like to see it?" Without pausing for a breath Christine responded, "Yes!"</p>
<p>Sherri proceeded to read through a translated booklet explaining God's love for us and what Christ had done on the cross. She shared how her friend could invite Christ into her heart right then, and that it would be the most important decision she would ever make. After discussing this at length Christine decided to put her faith in Christ, and prayed with Sherri that the Lord would enter her heart!</p>
<p>As Sherri left Christine's dorm room that day she thought about her "chance" meeting with a girl at a music store.  She smiled as she realized that it had not been a chance meeting at all, but a divine appointment from the Lord!</p>
